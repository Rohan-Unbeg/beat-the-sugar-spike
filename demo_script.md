# 🎬 Demo Video Script (Target: 2-3 Minutes)
**Goal:** Show, don't just tell. Demonstrate the "Magic Moments" of the app.

## 0:00 - 0:20: The Hook & Onboarding
*   **Visual:** Start on the Landing Page (`/`). Click "Start Journey".
*   **Action:**
    *   Quickly slide through the Onboarding (Age, Weight, Goal).
    *   *Highlight:* "Notice I didn't create an account. It's friction-free."
    *   Click "I PLEDGE".
*   **Audio:** "Hi, I'm Rohan. This is 'Beat the Sugar Spike'. We solve the problem of tedious calorie tracking by focusing on what matters: immediacy and context. We built a frictionless, no-signup experience that gets users to their first insight in under 15 seconds."

## 0:20 - 1:00: The Core Loop (Fast Logging)
*   **Visual:** You are now on the **Dashboard**.
*   **Action:**
    *   Tap the **"Coffee"** preset icon. (Show the toast popup + XP gain).
    *   **Say:** "Logging is one tap. But life isn't always presets."
    *   Open the **Voice Search** (Microphone Icon).
    *   **Say (into mic):** "I just had a large chocolate donut and a coke."
    *   **Visual:** Show the AI loading -> Parsing -> Result.
    *   **Say:** "We use Groq's Llama-3 to instantly parse natural language into nutritional data."
    *   Click "Add Log".

## 1:00 - 1:40: The "Context-Aware" Insight (The USP)
*   **Visual:** Point to the **Insight Card** (top right/center).
*   **Action:**
    *   Read the insight displayed (e.g., "High sugar spike detected...").
    *   **Say:** "This isn't generic advice. The app knows I'm sedentary right now."
    *   **Click "Explain Why"**: Reveal the biological text.
    *   **Say:** "We included an 'Explainable AI' layer so users understand the biology, not just the rule. It teaches them *why* this matters."

## 1:40 - 2:20: Real-Time Bio-Simulation (The Tech Flex)
*   **Visual:** Point to the **"Health Sync"** badge or Live Activity indicator.
*   **Action:**
    *   Wait for the "Live Sync" notification to pop up (Steps/Heart Rate updating).
    *   **Say:** "Since we can't connect to physical watches in a web demo, we built a real-time background engine that simulates user activity. Watch what happens when my simulated steps increase..."
    *   *(Optional: If you can, trigger a high step count via the simulator logic or just explain it)*: "The AI adjusts its advice based on this real-time stream. If I walk more, it allows more sugar buffer."

## 2:20 - End: Gamification & Closing
*   **Visual:** Click the **Profile/Trophy** icon.
*   **Action:**
    *   Show the **Streak** flame and **Level Progress**.
    *   **Say:** "We use the Fogg Behavior Model. The Trigger is the craving, the Ability is our 10-second log, and the Motivation is this gamified streak system."
*   **Closing:** "Beat the Sugar Spike. Built with Next.js, Firebase, and Groq. Thank you."
